# Machine-Learning-ML-
Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects that showcase a wide range of machine learning techniques and real-world applications. Each project is designed to solve practical problems using data-driven approaches and predictive modeling.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main categories: Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.
Each category contains projects grouped by application area such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

# Main Categories
**Supervised Learning**
Projects where models learn from labeled data, when we use algorithm like:
- Classification
- Regression

**Unsupervised Learning**
Projects where models discover patterns from unlabeled data:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection

# How to Navigate
Each project directory contains:
- README.md — Detailed documentation about the project, including its objective, dataset description, methodology, and how to run the code.
- Source Code — The main implementation of the model and preprocessing pipeline.
- Datasets — Links or references to the datasets used.
- Results — Model outputs, visualizations, and performance metrics.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
